### Hi there 👋 I'm Atharva Muratkar

I'm a passionate Full-Stack Developer with experience in building dynamic and scalable web applications. I have a strong background in both frontend and backend technologies, including React.js, Next.js, Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MongoDB.



#### What I'm up to?

🌱 I’m currently expanding my skills in modern tech stacks and diving deeper into creating intuitive user interfaces and efficient backend solutions.

💼 I've worked on diverse projects, including an eCommerce platform called EbookHeaven and a portfolio website for an architecture firm named ArchInterio Design Studio.

🚀 My goal is to build applications that deliver seamless user experiences and solve real-world problems.
